# Projectile Motion Simulation

Features:
 - Physics Simulation containing a cannon that shoots the projectile (ball) at a specific angle and velocity.
 - Interactive side menu with adjustable variables (namely launch velocity, angle of launch and gravitational field strength).
 - Gives a 2 decimal place approximation to the maximum height reached by the projectile, the total time of flight and the range of the projectile.
